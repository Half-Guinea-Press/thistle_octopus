# The second post...

A.K.A. Another place holder while I figure out how to do this...

``` mermaid
graph LR

  DMH[Dungeon Master Helper] --> DMH1[Dice Roller]
  DMH --> DMH2[NPC Builder]
  DMH --> DMH3[QR Code Generator]
  DMH --> DMHT[DMH Tracker]
  DMHT --> DMHT1[Initiative Tracker]
  DMHT --> DMHT2[Hit Points Tracker]
  DMHT --> DMT3[Equipment Tracker]
  DMHT --> DMHT4[Resource Tracker]

```

``` mermaid
graph LR

  WB[World Building] --> WBV[World Build Variables]
  WBV --> WBV1[Time as core variable]
  WBV --> WBV2[Location as second core variable???]
  WB[World Building] --> WB1[Cosmology]
  WB[World Building] --> WB2[World Geography]
  WB[World Building] --> WB3[Flora]
  WB[World Building] --> WB4[Fauna]
  WB[World Building] --> WB5[Species Uplift Location]
  WB[World Building] --> WB6[Settlements]
  WB[World Building] --> WB7[Cultures]
  WB[World Building] --> WB8[Catastrophes]
  WB[World Building] --> WB9[When Species/Cultures Collide]
  WB[World Building] --> WB10[Migration/Expansion]

```
