# The second post...

A.K.A. Another place holder while I figure out how to do this...

``` mermaid
graph LR

  DMH[Dungeon Master Helper] --> DMH1[Dice Roller]
  DMH --> DMH2[NPC Builder]
  DMH --> DMH3[QR Code Generator]
  DMH --> DMHT[DMH Tracker]
  DMHT --> DMHT1[Initiative Tracker]
  DMHT --> DMHT2[Hit Points Tracker]
  DMHT --> DMT3[Equipment Tracker]
  DMHT --> DMHT4[Resource Tracker]

```

``` mermaid
graph LR

  WB[World Building] --> WBV[World Build Variables]
  WBV --> WBV1[Time as core variable]
  WBV --> WBV2[Location as second core variable???]
  WB --> WBC[Cosmology]
  WB --> WBG[World Geography]
  WB --> WBW[Wildlife]
  WBW --> WBWFL[Flora]
  WBW --> WBWFA[Fauna]
  WBWFL -->WBWU[Wildlife Uplift]
  WBWFA -->WBWU
  WBWU --> WBWU1[Migration/Expansion]
  WBWU --> WBWU2[Settlements]
  WBWU --> WBWU3[When Species/Cultures Collide]
  WBWU --> WBWU4[Cultures]
  WB --> WBCAT[Catastrophes]

```
