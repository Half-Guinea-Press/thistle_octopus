# The second post...

A.K.A. Another place holder while I figure out how to do this...

``` mermaid
graph LR

  DMH[Dungeon Master Helper] --> DMH1[Dice Roller]
  DMH --> DMH2[NPC Builder]
  DMH --> DMH3[QR Code Generator]
  DMH --> DMHT[DMH Tracker]
  DMHT --> DMHT1[Initiative Tracker]
  DMHT --> DMHT2[Hit Points Tracker]
  DMHT --> DMT3[Equipment Tracker]
  DMHT --> DMHT4[Resource Tracker]
  WB[World Building] --> WB1[Time as core variable]
  WB[World Building] --> WB2[Cosmology]
  WB[World Building] --> WB3[World Geography]
  WB[World Building] --> WB4[Flora]
  WB[World Building] --> WB5[Fauna]
  WB[World Building] --> WB6[Species Uplift Location]
  WB[World Building] --> WB7[Settlements]
  WB[World Building] --> WB8[Cultures]
  WB[World Building] --> WB9[Catastrophes]
  WB[World Building] --> WB10[When Species/Cultures Collide]
  WB[World Building] --> WB11[Migration/Expansion]
  WB[World Building] --> WB12[Location as second core variable???]

```
